Aight so this is an autograder for the C class. Its not that hard to use just make sure g++ works in your command prompt. Also put the FOLDER the exe is in, not the actual exe into your path or it wont work.

## Usage:

### Step 1:
- Download the repository (or just the `.exe` file if you prefer).

### Step 2:
- Add the folder containing `autograde.exe` to your system PATH. By default, it is located in the `dist` folder of this repository.

### Step 3:
- Open a command prompt in the directory where you want to run the autograder. Make sure the directory has the following structure:
- [tc_hwXX] # Folder containing the test cases 
- [your_c_program.c]

### Step 4:
- Assuming the program has all the necessary data, including the test cases within the `tc_hwXX` folder, run the following command:
```shell
autograde -n [your_c_program.c] -hw [homework number, e.g., 1 for homework 1] -c [name of the executable after compilation]
